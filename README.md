## Scope

This project aims to build the capability to calculate the carbon emissions of an application via static analysis of the code and any infrastructure as code files in a repository.

This tooling covers the pipeline from a git commit, up to deployment, in a typical continuous integration/continuous deployment process.

Considered approaches include:

1. A GitHub Action to run during deployment
2. A GitHub Action to run on a pull request
3. A Pre-commit application to run every time a commit is made
